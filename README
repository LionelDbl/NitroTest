BUILD
-----

The application can be built with:

	(1) Visual Studio 2013 via the solution NitroTest.sln
	  the binary NitroTest.exe will be generated in Release or Debug depending on the configuration used in Visual Studio
	  
	(2) the bash script build.sh
	  the binary NitroTest will be generated in bin
	  

HOW TO USE
----------

Put a JSON_file in the same folder of the executable NitroTest
Launch the command: NitroTest.exe JSON_file
An output.txt file will be generated in the same folder as the executable NitroTest


REQUIREMENTS
------------

I used a specific format for the validation of the JSON file, see JSON.txt.
I assumed the JSON must contain the right number of tabulation at the beginning of the lines.
The JSON file must comply with this format otherwise it will not be processed.
